Iris Flower Classification
This project was completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The goal of the project was to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica, using various machine learning models and data visualization techniques.

Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features were used to predict the species of the Iris flower.

Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: A statistical model used for binary classification, extended here for multiclass classification.
Decision Tree: A tree-based classifier that splits data into branches to make decisions.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.
Data Visualization Techniques
To better understand the data and the classification process, the following visualizations were used:

Bar Plot: Visualizes the distribution of the target variable.
KDA Plot: Kernel Density Approximation, used to estimate the probability density of the features.
Scatter Plot: Visualizes relationships between different feature pairs.
Strip Plot: Used to display the distribution of the dataset points along a continuous axis.

How to Run the Project
1.Preprocessing the data: Load and split the dataset into training and test sets.
2.Training the Models: Run the models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN) on the training data.
3.Evaluating the Models: Test the models on unseen data and compare their accuracy.
4.Visualizing Results: Use the various plots to visualize the classification performance and data distribution.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how basic machine learning algorithms can effectively classify species using simple features. The visualizations helped in providing insights into the separability of the species based on their features.
