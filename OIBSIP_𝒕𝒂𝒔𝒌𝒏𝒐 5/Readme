SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON :

This project implements a sales prediction model using linear regression in Python. The model predicts sales based on various features derived from exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
The analysis includes visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to understand relationships and correlations in the data.



Exploratory Data Analysi (EDA) :

EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the dataset. Key visualizations include:
Scatter Plot:  Used to visualize the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
Heatmap:  Displays the correlation matrix to identify potential multicollinearity and relationships between features.


Model Training and Evaluation :
The model is trained using the following steps:

Data Preparation: Loading the dataset and performing necessary preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).

Splitting the Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Model Training: A linear regression model is trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess its predictive accuracy.

Libraries Used :
This project utilizes the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations, especially heatmaps.
